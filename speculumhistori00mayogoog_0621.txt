This work hus long been jmtly celebrated, but not thoroughly understood until
Mr. Stubbe' edition. The earlier portion, extending from 732 to 1148‚uppars
to be a copy oi a oompilntion made in Northumbrin about 1161, ιο which
Horeden added little. From 1148 to 1169-41 very vulnoble portion of this
work-the matter ie derived from another source, to which Hoveden uppem to
hare supplied little, ond not always jndiciomly. From 1170 to 1192 ie the
portion which oorreeponds with the Chroniele known under the nume oi
Benediet of Peterborough (see No. 49); but it is not ο copy, being sometimes
nn ubn'dgment, ut others a purephmne3 oeoueionully the two vorke entirely
agree, showing thnt both writers had uocem to the eume materiale, but dealt
with them differently. From 1191 ιο 1201 may bu mid to be wholly Hereden’s
work ; itis extremely rnluable, und un authority oi tire first importando
