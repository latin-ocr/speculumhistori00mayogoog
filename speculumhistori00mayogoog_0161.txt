Iu the deccat Introduction (by Mn. Τ. Ι). Hardy) to
the Meuaniam diatonica Britannico, Lond, 1818, fol,

p. 33, we read :-

“ Great doubt hange over the authenticity cf the work of
“ Richard os Girencester. Bertram himself speaks doubtfully
“ about the author,-‘ Auctor creditur celeberrimus Ricardus
‘⁶ ‘ (lerinensis, e Oirencestria oriundus ;' aud he gives uo account
‘⁴ ol the manuscript. Stukcley states, p. 12, that Bertram first
“ mentioned a manuscript ol Richard cf cirencester, being a
“ History of Roman Britain, and an ancient map annexed, as
“being ina friend’s hands. At Stukeley'e nequest Bertram
‘⁴ sent au extract from the manuscript, and afterwards an imita·
“ tion ol* the handwritiug of it, which Caeley, the keeper ol' the
‘⁸ Cotton Library, pronounced ιο be four hundred years old.
‘⁶ Stulreley then pressed Beria-am to gettha manuscript into his
“ hands, il' possible, which at length with some difficulty he
“ accomplished, andsentStukeleyatranscript citha whole, and a

“ objections to his work, and tlrc apologies he offers for any
‘⁶ mistake he may have committed, are very suspicions circum·
⁴⁶ stances; nor is the marvelloue manner in which Bertram got
“ possession ol' the manuscript, and his silence as to its place of
“ deponit aud owner, lese sc. Enquiriee which have recently
‘⁴ been made at copenhagen strengthen these suspicions.”

tle hiatmp of Greci Britain (card Irelucd, ιο tlte end of
ilco reign os Hcecy VH, Vol. i, Lond, 1862, dvo,
p. 647, Mr. Hardy simply says :—

“ 'l'he treatise ‘Dc Situ Britanniae,' which was published by
