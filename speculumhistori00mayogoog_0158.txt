“lt is not generally known that the original letters lrom
“ Bertram ιο Dr. Stukeley, respecting the manuscript ol Richard
“ of cirencester, are now in my possession, together with the
‘¹ whole ol the Doctor's Diades, and also numerous Manuscripta
‘⁶ aod Sketehes. 'lte letters extend over a period cf two years,
‘⁴ and satisfactorily exonerata Stukeley from aparticipation in
‘⁶ the fraud, il, indeed, eny vas committed by Bertram. Some
‘⁸ years ago Isubmitted the correspondenoe ιο a friend whose
‘⁴ atlaiumeuts render him highly quulilied ιο form uu opinion ou*
‘¹ the eubject; the Reverend J oeeph Hunter. That gentleman
'⁴ favoured me with a letter, whereiu he adverte ιο the very
“ suspicions manner in which Bertram professes ιο have obtained
“possession ol the original manuscript. Au Englishrusn, he
“ steten, who had been wild in his youth, had stolen it out οι· a
“ larger manuscript inauEnglish library= he gaveit ιο Bertram,
“ at Oopeuhagen, eud enjoined him ιο keep it secret. Bertram
‘⁸ suffered no ons ιο see the said manuscript. ‘ln lact? says
“ hir. Hunter, ‘there is every reason ιο conclude that no eye
‘¹ ¹ ever was permitted ιο lull upon it bnt Bertram’s. He made
“ ‘the copy, and the engraving ol' the map, with hia own hunds.
‘¹ ‘When Stukeley suggested that the manuscript should be
‘¹ ⁶ deposited iu the British Murcum, aud offered to purchase it
‘⁶ ⁸ ior thet purpose, Bertram would not listen ιο the proposal.
‘⁶ ‘No one is known ιο heve seen it, Bertram living r-uo one
‘⁸ ¹ pretends ιο heve heard οι· it, Bertram dead.’ coupling these
‘¹ circumstances with such oi the interual evidence as tends ιο
“ render the authenticity ol the work doubtful, Mr. Hunter
