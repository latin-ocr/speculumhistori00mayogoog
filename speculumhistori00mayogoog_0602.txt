Assar back as the year 1800, a Oomnrittee of the House of Oommons
recommended that Indexes and Calendars should be made to the Public
Records, and thirty-six years afterwards another Committee of the House of
Commune reiteratcd that recommendatiou in more foroible words; but it
was not until the incorporation of the State Paper Office with the Public
Record Offiee that the present Master of the Rolls found himself ln a position
to talre the necessary steps for carrying out the wishes of the House of
Commoris

On 7 December 1855, he stated to the Lords of the 'l'reasury that although
“ the Recorda, State Papers, and Documenta in his charge constitute the most
“ complete and perfect series of their kind in the civilized world‚'' and
although “they are of the greatest value in a histor-isal and constitutional
“ point of view, yet they are comparatively useless to the public, from the
“ want of proper Calendars and Indexes.”

Acting upon the recommendatione of the Committees of the House of
Commons above referred tc, he suggested to the Lords of the lheasury that
to effect the object he had in view it would be necessary for him to employ a
few persons fully qualified to perform the work which he contemplated.

Their Lordships assented to the necessity of having Calendars prepared
aad printed, and empowered the Master of the Rolls to take surh steps as
might be necessary for this purpose.

The following Works have been already publiahed under the direction of
the Master of the Rolls 2-
