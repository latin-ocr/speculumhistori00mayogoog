“ English tangue in the Royal mariue Academy oi Copaidem, a 'lhe De
‘⁶ person unknown ιο me. 'I'he letter was polite, full oi compli· εἰη Μ
“ ments, as usual with foreigners, expressing much candor and ffiesn'
“ respect to me, being only acquainted with some werke oi 7⁸
“ mine published. the letter was dated the year before: for all
‘⁸ that time he hesitated in sending it.

‘⁶ Soon after my receiving it, I sent a civil snswer: which
“produced another letter, with a prolix and elaborate tutin
‘⁸ epistle iuclos’d, from the famous Mr. Gramm, privyooun·
‘¹ sallor, and chief librarian ιο his Daniele hiajesty: a learned
“ gentleman who had been in Enplmtd ond visited our uni·
⁴⁴ versities. (hir. isonia Felices remembered him.) he was
“ Mr. Bertrom's great friend and patron.

‘⁸ 1 answered that letter, and it created a correspondenco
⁸⁸ between us. among other matters, hdr. Bertrom mentioned
‘⁸ a manuscript in a iriend’s hands, oi Richnrd of Woetmc'ncter,
“ being a history ol Roman Brittot'n, which he thought a great
⁴⁸ curiosity: and an antient map oi the island annex’d.

“In meander, that year, the ane of Montana, who was
‘⁸ pleas’d ιο have a favor lor me, drew me from a belovcd
‘⁴ retirement, where Ι proposed to spond the remainder oi my
⁴‘ life: therefore wonder'd the more, how lir. Bostram ionnd
“ me out. nor wael sollicitous about Richcrd of Wectmioeter,
'⁶ as he then called him, till I was presented ιο St. Georye's
‘⁴ church, Quaen-square. when 1 became fix’d in Londeo,1
“thought it proper to cultivate my Gopeohoyen correspon-
“ denne, and 1 received another lotio letter from Mr. Gramm,
‘⁴ and soon aiter en account oi his doeth, and a print os him
“ in proila.

“I now began to think ol the manuscript, end desired some
“ little extrem from it; then, an imitation oi the hand-writing,
“ which 1 shewed to my late friend ΜΓ. Oneley, keeper in the
‘⁸ Cotton librery, who immediately pronounoed it ιο ιο 400
“ years old.

¹⁴ I press’d Mr. Bertram to get the manuscript into his hands,
“ ii possible. which et length, with some difficulty, he accom-
“ pliehed: and on my sollicitation, sent ιο me in letters, a
“ manscript oi the whole; end et last a copy οι· the mapz he
'‘ haring an excellent hand iu drawing.

“Upon perusal, I serionsly sollicited him ιο print it, as the

‘⁶ greatest treasure we now can hoaut ol, iu this kind οι· learn-
“ ing. in the' meantime, I have here extracted some account
·· ll‘ilffl‘iffildi lwlttt ‘diffidi' theti
