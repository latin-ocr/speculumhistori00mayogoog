“ I cannot agree with him in his opinion of Richard.''

In p. 119 Reynolds oombats Whitaker's statement
that tho Itinerary “ was drawn up ae early as the
“ middle nithe second century.” Pp. 120, 121:-

“ This author must heve had very little foundation ior his
“ province Vespasiano ...... This was an ingenious and
“ innocent fiction very admissihle in the fourteenth century,
‘¹ but it cannot bear the test of historical investigation. .....
“ Very few towns are seen in Antoninus, which are not found in
‘⁶ Richard. . . . The five first towns of the tenth Iter have
‘⁶ exaroised the ingenuity of commentatore more than any in
“ the whole Itinerary‚ and to no purpose, having never yet
“ been positively determined. No wonder then if it should
“ have exceeded the sagacity of Rioherd to weave them in his

’ “ Diaphragmate. Among the towns of the remaining five Iters
‘⁴ only Maridunum is omitted. . ι . . Thus of the one hundred
“ and thirteen towns of Antoninus, Richard hes only omitted
“ eleven or twelve. This must be admitted a very stieng
‘¹ probable praef, that the work of the Romm General, referred
‘⁸ to by this ingenious monk, must be that commonly known
“ under the title of the Itineravy of Antoninus.

‘⁴ This is further confirmed by the manner, in which wc find
‘⁴ the towns, taken from the Itinerary, dispersed in the Dia-
‘⁴ phragmate ...... Their order is changed, sometimes the
“towns following ,each other in the order they are found in
“ Antonine, at others thet order is reversed. Some few towns
“ are transplanted from one Iter into another. Some Iters are
‘⁴ composed partly from Antoninus, and partly lhom Ptolemy,
‘⁶ aud other authors. Among the latter may bc distinguished
‘¹ Tacitus and Pliny among the Romans, and Nennius and
‘¹ Bede among our old English writers3 and probably there are
“ others of the latter class whose works may not have come
“ down to the present times. Had Richard himself been
‘⁸ tempted to make the world believe, that the whole of thie
“ Itinerery was not only of his own fabrication, but invention
‘⁴ also, surely Antonine's work would have been considered a
⁴¹ complete aud convinoing evidence to the contrary.

“And there would have been more reason to suspect, that
