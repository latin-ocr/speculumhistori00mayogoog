“This vsluehle work, end more vulushle mep . . . contains

Τ. Nash, Hiot. of worcestershire, Lond. 1781, fol. 1. iv.
cites the “ De Situ ’¹ se derived from—

“ Some fragments left by a Romen general, together with
“ some sdditions from Ptolemy.”

Gibbon's ohiei notice of the “ De Situ '’ hes been already
given. In hie first volume (1776, lto, u. 32 ou o. 2) he
nites es authentio the list of Romen oolonies in o. 7, p. 36.
In o. 13, n. 25 he is more wury:

“The three expressions of uuuopirs Aurelius Vlotor‚ end
‘⁶ Eumenius, vitiosiore notos, Botovloe olorum. end Menapiis
“ rioth, give us e very doubtful uooount of the birth of ceraunius.

The only remaining quotation isin vol 2. (o. 25, u. 111,
1781), where we read:

“The penetro history, whieh he [John Whiteker] produces,
