Bertram’s facsimile¹ bears no resemblance tc the

. handwriting of the ltth, or, indeed, of any century3 it

is plainly a clumsy forgery hy an unpractised hand, not
e tracing or copy from a genuine original.

Even on Bertram's own showing the Dc situ was
assigned to Richard of Oirencester on very insufficient
grounds. The MS, we are told, bore the name of Richard
of Westminster; when informed by Stukeley that
Richard of Oireucester wos an eminent westminster
monk, Bertram inserted “Conmendo’' in his title, but
in his prefsce says modestly, “Auctor creditur R1cs'snos
Oosmmsrs.''

The internal evidence is no less damaging. This
Westminster monk, who in his Speculum never cites
even an ancient poet at first hand, has himself, and osten
implies in his readers, a familiar acquaintance with the
most recondite evidence, Greek as well as Latin, frag·
ments, inscriptions, coins, works extant (like the ahsa
Pontioyeroacu) only in one distent copy, or (like the ’
Oosrnoyrapho'c Ravennatis) only in three MSS. os the
ltth century3 twice he quotes Greek (1. 4 ς 11 ; 6 §18);
he follows Camden’s order, Oamden's divisions os Britain,
Oemden’s and Baxter’s gomses, Gamden's Iatin versione,
and general Lotinity (eg, primum), Camden's blun-
ders (I. 3 5511, 21; 6 §th His list of the hecti in
Britain does not extend beyond Horsley’s, and includesa
second Trebellius whom Horsley added by mistake He
foists into Oaesar‘s text a clause invented by Oudendorp,
not es an emendation, but as an imaginsry illustration
of a grammatical rule. The use made of these authori-
ties is at once dishonest and awkward ; what Oaesar says
of the Gauls, Tacitus of the Germane, is applied with·
