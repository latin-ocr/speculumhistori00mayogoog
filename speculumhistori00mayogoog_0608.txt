01125 July 1822, the House of Commoris presented an address to the
(fromn, stating that the editions of the works of our ancient historians were
inconvenient and defective3 that many of their writinge still remained in
manuscript, and, in some cases, in a single copy only. They added, “that an
“ uniform and convenient edition of the whole, published under His Majesty's
“ royal sanction, would be an undertaking honourable to His Majesty’s reign,
“⁶ and conducite to the advancement of historical and constitutional know·
“ ledge; that the House therefore humbly besought His Majesty‚ that He
‘¹ would be graciously pleased to give such directions aa His Majesty, in His
‘⁶ wisdom‚ might think fit, for the publication of ocomplete edition of the
‘⁶ ancient historiens of this malm, and assured His Majesty that whatever
’ “ expense might be necessary for this purpose would be made good.‘’

The Mastcr of the Belle, being very desirous that effect should be given
to the resolution of the House of Commoris, submittcd to Her Maiesty’s
Treaeury in 1857 a plan for the publication of the ancient chronicles aad
memoriale of the United Kingdom‚ and it was adopted accordingly. In
selecting these worhs, it was considered right, iu the first instance, to
give preference to those of which the manuscripts were unique, or the
materiale of which would help to llll up blanks in English history for
which no satisfactory and authentic information hitherto existed in any
accessihle form. One great object the Master of the Rolls had in view was
to forma corpas historicam within reasonable limite, and which should be
as complete as possible. In a subject of so vast a range, it was important
that the historical student should be able to select auch volumes as conformed
with his own peculiar testes and studies, and not be put to the expense of

Ι purchasing the whole collecti0n; an inconveniente inseparable horn any

other plan than that which has been in this instance adopted.

Of the Chronicles and Memorials‚ the following volumes have been pub-
lished. They embrace the period from the earliest time of British 'history
down to the end of the reign of Henry VII.
