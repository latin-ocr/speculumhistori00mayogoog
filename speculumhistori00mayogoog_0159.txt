In the onccedioye of tte H istocic Sooictp os Lovtooae

“ the Itinerery ol Richard, omont< of cirencester,” es “either
“ copied from some more extensive work or better Mes. ol

In vol. ii. (lest-50), Dr. A. Hume (p. 28) refers to the
Itinerery es genuine. In the seme vol. (p. ³7) John
Robson, Esq, os Werrington, quotes Rioherd to point
out his variatione from Antoninus, noting‚ however, thet
the authenticity of his-

“ description ol' Britain is not admitted by Petrie.”

In vol iii. (1850-1), pp. 3-10, Mr. Just comments on
the seventh Iter, still without suspicion, end ΜΓ. Robeou
(illel. 10-12) fairly reises the charge of forgery.
