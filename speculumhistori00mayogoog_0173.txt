credulity which hus been blind to it. Heving four
stutions A, B, O, D, Bertrsm reckons four distances
between the extremes, adding, that is, to the sum the
distance between D und E (see p. lxxxvii. above);
similarly he names six provinces, but makes their sum
seven (p. xxxin).

If these criticisms are just, Bertrum's success is u

years. Το sey nothing of antiquaries whose canons of ,
