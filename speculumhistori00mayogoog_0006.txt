—.- .-

Ou the 26th of J anuery 1857, tho Master 01 the Rolls
submitted 10 the lheasury a proposal 101 the publication
01 materials 101 the History 01 this Country lrom the
Invasion of the Romans 10 the Reign 01 Henry VIII.

TheMaster of the Rolls suggested that these materiale
should be selected for publication under competent
editors without reference 1ο periodical or chronological
arrangement, without mutilation or abridgment, prefer-
ence being giren, in the first instance, to such materials
as were most scarae and raluable.

He proposed thet each chronicle or historioal docu-
ment 10 be edited should be treated in the same way as
if the editor were engaged on an Editio Princeps3 and
101 this purpose the most correct text should bc formed
11011 an accurate collation of the best MSS.

Το render the work more generally useful, the Mastcr
01 the Rolls suggested that the editor should give an
account 01 the Mas. employed by him, 01 their age and
their poeuliarities; that he should add to the work 1
brief account 01 the life and times of the author, and any
remarks necessary 10 explain the chronology; but no
other note or comment was to be allowed, except what

might be necessary 10 establish the correctness 01 the
text. ·
