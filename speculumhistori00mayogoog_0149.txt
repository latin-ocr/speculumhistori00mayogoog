‘⁸ Ι pay considerable deference to the authority of Richard‚ the
‘⁶ monk of Girencester.”

John Hodgson, Clk„ History os Northumberlaml‚
1827, 4t0., pt. 2, vol. i. p. 146:

‘⁶ My readers may feel some surprise why Ι have not, on the au-
“ thority of the work ‘⁶ De Situ Britannice,” attributed to Richard
“ of Cirenceste1·, raised Bremenium to the rank of one of the
‘⁸ twelve stipendiary cities in Britain. And here Ι think it my
‘⁸ duty frankly to confess, with all due deference to the able critics.
‘⁸ who have admired the clearness and the sagacity of that work,
‘⁸ aud have written in defence of its authenticity, that after
“ much reflexion on the subject my saith in its credit has entirely
“ given way. After diligent enquiry being made in copenhagen
‘⁶ sor the manuscript from which Mr. Ber-tram professes to have
“ taken his transcript‚ no account of it could be procured. In
“ a metropolis abounding with antiquaries, wh0‚ from the
‘⁶ ancient peculiar connexion of their own country with this,
“ had often gone deeply into the study of British antiquities,
“ no one could be found who had heard of the work, or seen its
“ name in any catalogue of manuscripts. The fac-simile os its
“ first page, which accompanies the printed editions os it, is not

‘⁶ in the style of any manuscripts of Richard’s time, that Ι have

“ century before him3 and contains abbreviations unwarranted
“ by ancient example. The language‚ tec, of the body of the
“ book, is much too classical and pure to be expected from a
“ monk of the fisteenth [sic] century 3 and especially from one
“ whose acknowledged historioal works are, in point of language
“ and enquiry, scarcely on a level with the dull and ignorant
“ productions of his contemporaries. Mr. Bertram’s notes on
“ it shew that he was an elegant scholar, a diligent antiquary,
“ and an accurate critic, and fully capable of concocting the
‘⁶ work ‘ De Situ Britannice ;’ the style of which corresponds so
⁴⁴ much with that of his own, that till some good account can be
*¹ given how the original MS. came into his hands, and how
¹· he disposed of it, we cannot see any good ground for not
'¹ suspecting him to have been the author of it. If Mr.*Bertram
