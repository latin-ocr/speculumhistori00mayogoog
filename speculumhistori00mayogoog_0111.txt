{plectite This argument is of itself decisive against Bertram,
as will appear to any scholar familiar wrt 'th classicai ond
monastic Lat· t,1n and with what tis known as Noten-
Laretn‚10n perusing the following semples.

DSeitm

Ι. 2, § 3. Tertium est contra septemtriones. Bertram is fond
ol this plural, which does not, so sar as Ι remember, occur in

Richard.

Ι. 3, t 1. “ Solis quippe Judaeis, et per ipsos finitimis quibus·
“ darn gentibus, hoc contigit felicitatis, ut b primo inde mundi
“ exordio gentis suae originem continua serie ex infallibilibus
‘⁶ deducere possint monumentis.” Bertram plainly knew some·
thing of the Deistic coutroversies of the ege; here and else-
where, in his own person and in Richard’s, he refers to or

απῙΙςῶατᾱῙγ compliments the Bible narrative. See his notes
p. .

Ι. 3, § 3, and often. Heio ,⁴ so Bertram spells the adverb, both
in text and notes ς Richard has the form bie.

Ι. 3, § 4: “pro ulteriori signo inservit Druidum traditio.'’
A phrase which recurs Ι. 8, § 9. How did the monk, aiter the
lepse oi 1200 years, know the tradimus» of the Druidet

Ι, 3,§ 19. “Formam regiminis Brittanici‚ autb advectos in
‘⁴ hanc insulam Romanos, determinare haud faciles hoe certum,
“ quod nulium ibi ante haee tempora Monarchici imperii resti·
“ gium, sed Democraticum luisse, potiris ridetur, nisi forte
“ Aristocratiam emulari videatur. Druidum in rebus maxumi
“momenti authoritas non exigua. commemorantur· quidem
“ iu antiquissimis eorum monumentis Principes nonnulli.”
Again extant Druid documenta.

Ι. 4, §92 imese. Bertram gives au uir oi antiquity to his
Latinity by writing michi, nichil. Here he agrees with the
MS. of the Speculatus. But he hed not knowledge enough to '
insert genuine forms, such as proici, optinuit, bracchio, gestamme,
milio, arsulae, sequias, tempto, which continually, some of them
exclusively, occur in the Speculum ,· he writes mmullo Ι. 3,§ 21.

Ι. 4,§ 11. Δρυιδες, Greek here and below, asamattor of course,
from the pen ol a mouk ol the fourteeuth century.
